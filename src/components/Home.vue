            Surprisingly, multiple people in the same room within the same
            environment/atmosphere, inhaling the same smell molecules in the
            air, can have differing opinions about its smell, whether it be its
            pleasantness, intensity, or similarity to other odors.<br />
            <br />
            This is a preliminary survey about smell perception, which will
            someday be applied to better understand smell experiences,
            multisensory interactions, and its contributions to technology.<br />
